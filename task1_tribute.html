        <tr><td><p>Dr. Kalam was a natural writer in every sense. His famous quote that, 
            “<i>the best teacher does not teach from the book, but from the heart</i>” reveals everything about the invaluable writing legacy that he left in the world. Some of his most popular writing works include Wings of Fire (1999), Mission India (2005), Ignited Minds: Unleashing the Power Within India (2002), My Journey: Transforming Dreams into Actions (2013), Envisioning an Empowered Nation (Written with A Sivathanu Pillai), India 2020: A vision for the New Millennium (1998) (written with Y S Rajan), Developments in Fluid Mechanics and Space Technology, 1988 (Written with Roddam Narasimha) and Turning Points (2012).</p>

         <p> The best thing that one can find in Dr. Kalam’s work is its simplicity. He never tried to compel his readers to mug-up philosophical or technical terms or research findings. Instead, he emphasized more on the lifetime experiences, natural incidences, successes and most importantly, failures. All of his work tried to open the gates of the spirit and the mind of the reader to judge the emptiness inside and conduct a self study and assessment to aspire.</p>
